# Example chronological notes

Today I'm starting this new project! Yay! 

**A list of stuff:**

  - Blah bla
  - Blah da da da
  - Trololol lol lol

Today I learned this cool thing: you can do x y z things in vim and it's super easy!!! #vim #til

Oh also, I was thinking about this stuff.... then I got interrupted... this paragraph is not important at all, just stream of consciousness writing that I still want to have on record just because it might be interesting later for data analytics or nostalgia or whatever. But it doesn't need to be categorized or referenced later. It's not part of some larger collection of things.

Oh and my friend shared thi cool link with me: https://example.com super cool idea! #electronics #video #raspberrypi

This thing was hilarious... gotta remember this for later. #video #funny

Maybe I also have a code snippet in here while I'm taking notes on something new that I'm learning...

```javascript
let bla = "something cool here";

console.log(bla);
```

Not sure what I would do with code snippets but that would be cool for a future version of this app, like notes with an integrated code snippet management tool that make use of my hashtags or something... not sure how the formatting would work exactly, though...

Oh, don't forget about integratind MDX (Markdown with JSX mixed in!) for more cool possibilities!

And I guess that's enough for this example!!
