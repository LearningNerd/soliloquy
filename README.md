# Soliloquy

A note-taking and organizational tool based on stream-of-consciousness writing. Very much experimental, work in progress!

<hr/>
 
## Idea backlog:

  - Learn how to make a vim plugin for hashtag autocompletion
  - Learn how to make a CLI tool for writing very short snippets without opening up a notes file
  - Integration with a pomodoro-style timer / time-tracking, in-line with notes. (Might also be a Vim plugin)
  - Analytics on data, categories, dates
  - Web-based text editor
  - Markdown preview built in
  - Host online and sync across devices
  - Offline storage
  - Combine with a static blogging tool
